Thank you for the experience, due to the lack of time (work+dissertation) I only started to do the challenge today, 
Friday 9 so I didn't finish it.

How to build and run your application:
 Import it in eclipse/other IDE as maven project.
 Change the path to json File in the Class com.mercedes.tesDrive.dto.JsonParser;
 To run, just Run the com.mercedes.tesDrive.App Class.
 
 In Browser:
  List all vehicles by:
          Model: http://localhost:8080/model?model=E
          
          Fuel type: http://localhost:8080/fuel?fuel=ELECTRIC
          Transmission: http://localhost:8080/transmission?transmission=AUTO
          Dealer: http://localhost:8080/dealer?dealer=MB%20Lisboa
          
 List all bookings: http://localhost:8080/bookings?list=bookings

Explanation about your choices, their limitations and possible improvements:
I would complete the challenge if I had started earlier. With more time I would make add a beautifull interface instead of 
presenting the results as json in browser.
